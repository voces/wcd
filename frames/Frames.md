# Frames
The frames API was released in patch v1.31, giving map makers the capability to modify and created custom UI. This API allows for displaying and interacting with text, textures, and non-gameworld models (such as the Portrait).

The frames API introduces new natives and new file types. While the natives allow for creating and manipulating frames, the natives do not have as much functionality as that exposed with the new file types: FDF and TOC. FDF allows for defining UI components in a declarative fashion and provides more functionality than the native API. TOC (Table of Contents) is a required intermediary for loading in FDF files.
